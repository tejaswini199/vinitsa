As the first step towards the creation of a truly international student body, the pre-medical program was established. Regardless of the individual variations of the educational system, this program allows the matriculation of students from around the world of their home country.
</p>
<p>
Students enter the premedical program with the expectation, that eventually they will get accepted into the school of medicine in VNMU. Students of science (must have passed in Physics, Chemistry, English) are eligible to this program.
</p>
<p>
Along with the Ukrainian language, the pre-medical course is fully conducted in English.
</p>
<p>
The pre-medical course is of 10 months duration. Classes are conducted in hostel as well as in the university. Students have full use of all university resources, including all recreational facilities, accommodation, libraries, computer suites, and student services.
</p>
<p>
Pre-medical course offers students not only a standard university entrance qualification but also an excellent base for their further academic studies.
</p>
<p>
The program of the Ukrainian language gives the possibility to develop the students’ skills in making notes of scientific texts, communicating with the patients, understanding and writing lectures, mastering the special terminology. Here students also extend their knowledge of Chemistry, Physics, Biology, and Computer Science.
</p>
<p>
The Ministry of education and Ministry of Public health, Ukraine has approved the program of the pre-medical course curriculum and has given the right to enter the following faculties: medical faculty, Nursing, dentistry, and postgraduate training. These will help you not only to prepare for the content and level of the degree course subjects, but also to familiarize yourself with the method of teaching at “VINNYTSYA NATIONAL PIROGOV MEMORIAL MEDICAL UNIVERSITY”.
